# Hand-Written Digits Classification
### Overview
As part of the course "Machine Learning" we implemented from scratch the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm in order to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes, using the MNIST dataset.
MNIST is a large database of small, square 28*28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. It consists of a total of 70,000 handwritten images of digits, with the training set having 60,000 images and the test set having 10,000. All images are labeled with the respective digit that they represent. There are a total of 10 classes of digits (from 0 to 9).
